# Known Issues

## Test suite

### test_compiled.py — runtime and cache size

**Status**: Partially addressed (May 2026)

`tests/test_sim/test_compiled.py` is the compiled-engine regression suite.

#### Test count and runtime

The bulk of the tests live in `TestWideSignalExternalIO` (~3843 parametrized
tests across wide-signal ops and values). They are tagged `@pytest.mark.slow`
and **skipped by default**. Use `--run-slow` to include them:

```
uv run pytest tests/test_sim/test_compiled.py --run-slow
```

Full count with slow tests enabled: **4516 tests** (down from 6304 after Wave F-4
redundancy reduction on May 2026). Each slow test compiles a unique Cython module
(~5s first-run, <1s on cache hit).

#### Parallel execution with pytest-xdist

`pytest-xdist` is included in the `test` optional-dependency group. Each test
compiles a uniquely named Cython module (content-hash keyed) so parallel workers
never collide:

```
# fast path (skip slow): all CPU cores
uv run pytest tests/test_sim/test_compiled.py -n auto

# full suite with slow tests: parallel over all cores
uv run pytest tests/test_sim/test_compiled.py -n auto --run-slow
```

#### Cache size

`.cycache/` content-hashes compiled `.pyd` files per module. The full slow suite
generates ~4500 unique entries. Wave F-4 reduced that by ~1788 entries (28%).
Use `--clear-cython-cache` to wipe and rebuild from scratch.

#### Known xfail tests

- `TestWideSignalExternalIO::test_wide_posedge_signal_probe_cross_engine` —
  **xfail (May 2026)**: posedge on >64-bit signals is not supported in the
  compiled engine (`NotImplementedError`). Marked strict xfail.

## Simulator

### Cython VM interpreter drift (vm-fast engine)

**Status**: Open — noted in `setup.py` docstring, unverified recently

The Cython VM extension (`sim/vm/_interp_fast.pyx`) has drifted from the
pure-Python interpreter and was last observed failing ~18 tests under
`tests/test_sim/test_bench_native.py` (memory read-after-write divergence).
The `vm-fast` engine silently falls back to pure Python when the extension is
not built, so environments without the built extension are unaffected.
Workarounds: set `VERIFORGE_DISABLE_CYTHON_VM=1` or delete the built
`_interp_fast.*.pyd`/`.so`. Before relying on `vm-fast` with the extension
built, re-run that test file to confirm current status.

### Declared signedness is now honored (all engines)

**Status**: Resolved (June 2026)

The model carries `signed` through parse and elaboration (`Net.signed` /
`Variable.signed`), and all engines now respect it via IEEE 1364-2005 §5.5
expression-signedness propagation.  Signed comparison, arithmetic right-shift,
context-determined sign-extension, and assignment sign-extension all activate
when signal operands carry a declared-signed `True` flag — not only through
explicit `$signed()` calls.

See `tests/test_sim/test_testbench.py::TestSignedDeclarationSupport` for the
validation tests.

### x and z share one representation (3-state, not 4-state)

**Status**: By design — documented limitation

`sim/value.py` encodes x and z identically (`Value.z()` returns `Value.x()`).
Consequences: `===`/`!==` cannot distinguish x from z, tristate buses,
pullups, and high-impedance detection are not simulatable. This is a
deliberate RTL-subset trade-off (consistent with the support matrix's
"strength and tristate resolution: low priority"), but note that docs and
docstrings describing the simulator as "4-state" overstate it slightly.

### Compiled engine: 64-bit signal width limit

**Status**: Partially resolved
**Found**: Ibex simulation work (March 2026)
**Severity**: High — blocks real-world AXI/wide-bus designs

The compiled Cython engine originally stored all signals as C `long long` (64-bit),
which truncated wider values. That limitation is now only partially true: external
signal round-trips for `width > 64` have boundary support, but internal compiled
expression, assignment, NBA, and dirty-propagation codegen still has remaining
single-word assumptions. This still affects:

- AXI data buses (128, 256, 512 bits)
- Wide memory interfaces
- Large concatenations exceeding 64 total bits

The **reference** and **VM** engines use Python `int` and handle arbitrary widths
correctly. The remaining limitation is compiled-engine-specific.

See `notes/plans/architecture_review_2026-07.md` and
`notes/simulation/wide_signal_coverage.md` for status and potential approaches.

### Compiled engine: wide-emitter unary operator masking (latent)

**Status**: Open — not yet exercised by any test
**Found**: noted during May 2026 `_emit_unary` fix

In `_wide_emitter.py` (around line 3570), the `wide_not`/`wide_neg` primitive
call passes `dst_width` (context width) as the tail-mask parameter rather than
the operand width:

```python
lines.append(
    f"{pad}{prim}(_sc{slot}_v, _sc{slot}_m,"
    f" _sc{op_slot}_v, _sc{op_slot}_m, {n_words}, {dst_width})"
)
```

Per IEEE 1364-2005 Table 5-22, unary `-` and `~` are self-determined to the
operand width. If the primitive uses this parameter for masking, this is the same
class of bug that was fixed in the narrow-path `_emit_unary` (May 2026). No
failing test exercises it yet — a triggering case requires a >64-bit unary
expression evaluated in a strictly wider context.
